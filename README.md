Analyzed sales growth, customer segmentation, and product performance using advanced MySQL queries. I identified top-performing branches, profitable product lines, and anomalies in sales transactions to improve strategies. I segmented customers into spending tiers, identified repeat buyers, and analyzed payment preferences by city. I delivered actionable insights through SQL-driven analysis, enhancing decision-making with clear visualizations and reports.
